<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

Hello! I'm Bryan, a Data Engineer with over a decade of experience in building bespoke data solutions across a number of domains in both the public and private sector. My specialty lies in creating robust solutions to help address problems related to human behavior, especially bad actors abusing platforms. I have built numerous data solutions that have helped:
- investigate money laundering and terrorist financing,  
- detect fraud in the financial industry,  
- identify individuals at risk of being involved in gun violence,  
- investigate information operations conducted by foreign governments and militaries, and  
- monitor the success of automated content moderation techniques.  

My primary tech stack has been Python and SQL on the backend with HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend. I have dabbled in numerous frameworks, libraries and runtimes, including Django, React, Express, and Node.js. In terms of databases, I am mostly familiar with relational databases (PostgreSQL being my go to), and I have passing familiarity with NoSQL databases like MongoDB. My cloud experience is ranked in descending order as Azure, AWS, GCP.

This blog serves primarily as documentation for myself to remember what I did on various side projects, but also as a resource for recruiters to help them understand what technologies I'm familiar with and to what extent.
