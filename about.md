<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>

Hello! I'm Bryan, a self-taught software engineer. For the past 15 years, my career has focused primarily on building solutions to help address problems related to human behavior, especially bad actors abusing platforms. I have built solutions that have helped:

- investigate money laundering and terrorist financing,  
- detect fraud in the financial industry,  
- identify individuals at risk of being involved in gun violence,  
- investigate information operations conducted by foreign governments and militaries, and  
- monitor the success of automated content moderation techniques for trust & safety platforms.  

My primary tech stack has been Python and SQL on the backend with HTML/CSS/JS on the frontend, but lately I have become much more interested in getting closer to the metal. I have started to dig my heels into C and Assembly, and focusing more on how things work under the hood.

This blog serves primarily as documentation for myself to remember what I did on various side projects, but also as a resource for recruiters to help them understand what technologies I'm familiar with and to what extent.
